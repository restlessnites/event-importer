# Codebase Cleanup and Refinement

This document tracks the progress of cleaning up the `event-importer` codebase after the successful integration of PyInstaller and the resolution of the TicketFairy tool discovery issue.

## TODO

- [X] Analyze key commits with `git show` to understand recent changes.
- [X] Run `ruff` and `vulture` to identify dead code and cruft.
- [X] Fix import errors and verify application startup.
- [X] Verify that the TicketFairy integration is discovered dynamically.
- [X] Clean up dead code and cruft from the installer directory.
- [X] Review and fix tests that rely on dead code.
- [ ] Remove obsolete targets from Makefiles.
- [ ] Document PyInstaller build process and entry_points mechanism.
- [ ] Verify the application runs correctly from source.
- [ ] Verify the packaged application runs correctly.
- [ ] Verify the upgrade functionality works correctly.

## Progress Notes

### Phase 1: Analysis and Verification

Our initial goal was to clean up the codebase after a complex series of changes to implement PyInstaller packaging and fix a tool discovery issue with the TicketFairy integration.

1.  **Commit Analysis**: We began by analyzing the key commits (`a6fb97ec`, `43755450`, `25585ac5`) to understand the architectural shifts toward PyInstaller, versioning, and a self-updating mechanism.

2.  **Import Hell & Discovery Verification**: We encountered a series of `ImportError` crashes that were blocking the application from starting. These were caused by leftover code from a major refactoring. After methodically fixing each broken import, we successfully verified that both the CLI and MCP server's dynamic integration discovery mechanisms were working correctly.

### Phase 2: Static Analysis and Code Cleanup

With the application in a runnable state, we moved on to a deep clean of the code.

1.  **`ruff` and `vulture`**: We used `ruff` to fix a number of linting issues and `vulture` (with decreasing confidence levels) to identify a significant amount of dead code.

2.  **Manual Cleanup**: The user performed a large-scale manual removal of dead code across the entire application, which was far more efficient than I could have been.

### Phase 3: Test Suite Restoration

The massive code removal left the test suite in a broken state.

1.  **Identifying Failures**: We ran `pytest` and got a clear list of all failing tests. The failures were primarily `AttributeError` exceptions caused by tests trying to use methods and classes that no longer existed.

2.  **Fixing Tests**: We worked through the list of failures one by one, removing tests that were validating now-deleted code. This confirmed our suspicion that many of the tests were written for code coverage rather than to validate essential functionality.

### Current Status

The application is now in a much cleaner state. The test suite is passing with 50.18% coverage, and we have high confidence that the core logic is sound. We are now ready to tackle the final cleanup and documentation tasks.
